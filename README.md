# ML_SVM_EXAMPLE_DIGITS
Used SVM in DIGITS_data, 
DIGITS_data set is imported from sklearn.datasets load digits() 
Created different models with diffrenet kernals which include "linear","poly","rbf","sigamoid" and found best model, 
Heatmap was used for the visualisation, Hyperplane was plotted, 
for rthat pupose PCA(Principal Component Analysis) was used to reduce the dimensionality.
